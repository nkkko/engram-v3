# Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Code Quality and Developer Experience
- ✅ Integrated golangci-lint with a curated rule set in `.golangci.yml`
- ✅ Configured pre-commit hooks with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- ✅ Enhanced Makefile targets for lint, fmt, test
- ✅ Added lint-fix target for automatic fixes

### Phase 2: Architecture and Modularity
- ✅ Defined interfaces for core components under `internal/domain`
- ✅ Created storage engine abstraction and factory
- ✅ Created router abstraction and factory
- ✅ Created API engine abstraction and factory
- ✅ Implemented dependency injection in engine wiring
- ✅ Added Chi router implementation as alternative to Fiber
- ✅ Implemented domain-based engine initialization

### Documentation
- ✅ Created CONTRIBUTING.md with development workflow and standards
- ✅ Added implementation progress tracking in IMPLEMENTED.md
