# BadgerDB Optimization in Engram v3

This document describes the optimizations made to BadgerDB in Engram v3 for improved performance and reliability.

## Overview

Engram v3 uses BadgerDB as its primary storage engine, replacing the previous RocksDB implementation. The BadgerDB storage backend has been optimized for high-throughput workloads, especially in write-heavy scenarios with many concurrent clients.

## Default vs. Optimized Configuration

Engram v3 provides two BadgerDB configurations:

1. **Default Configuration**: Suitable for general-purpose use and development environments.
2. **Optimized Configuration**: Designed for production workloads with high throughput requirements.

The optimized configuration can be enabled with the `--storage-optimized` flag or `STORAGE_OPTIMIZED=true` environment variable.

## Key Optimizations

### Memory Management

#### Default Configuration
```go
Options.MemTableSize = 64 << 20 // 64MB
Options.ValueLogFileSize = 1 << 30 // 1GB
```

#### Optimized Configuration
```go
Options.MemTableSize = 256 << 20 // 256MB
Options.ValueLogFileSize = 2 << 30 // 2GB
Options.ValueLogMaxEntries = 10000000
Options.NumMemtables = 5
Options.NumLevelZeroTables = 10
Options.NumLevelZeroTablesStall = 15
```

**Benefits**:
- Larger memory tables reduce disk I/O and improve write throughput
- Larger value log files reduce the frequency of value log garbage collection
- Increased number of memory tables prevents stalls during flushing

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

#### Default Configuration
```go
Options.SyncWrites = true // Each write is synchronously flushed to disk
```

#### Optimized Configuration
```go
Options.SyncWrites = false // Batch writes for better performance
// Custom WAL sync goroutine that runs every 100ms
```

**Benefits**:
- Significantly improved write throughput (up to 10x)
- Better batching of disk operations
- Periodic fsync provides a good balance of durability and performance

### Compaction and Garbage Collection

#### Default Configuration
```go
// Default BadgerDB compaction and GC
```

#### Optimized Configuration
```go
// Background goroutine for automated value log GC when disk usage exceeds threshold
// Periodic compaction during low-activity periods
// Adaptive compaction based on workload patterns
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced storage space usage
- Improved read performance after compaction
- Automatic management of value log growth

### Bloom Filters and Caching

#### Default Configuration
```go
Options.BlockSize = 4 * 1024 // 4KB
Options.BloomFalsePositive = 0.01
```

#### Optimized Configuration
```go
Options.BlockSize = 16 * 1024 // 16KB
Options.BloomFalsePositive = 0.001
Options.BlockCacheSize = 256 << 20 // 256MB
Options.IndexCacheSize = 128 << 20 // 128MB
```

**Benefits**:
- Larger block size improves sequential read performance
- More accurate Bloom filters reduce unnecessary disk reads
- Larger caches improve read performance for frequently accessed data

### Concurrency Control

#### Default Configuration
```go
Options.NumCompactors = 2
Options.MaxTableSize = 64 << 20 // 64MB
```

#### Optimized Configuration
```go
Options.NumCompactors = runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) // Use all available cores
Options.MaxTableSize = 128 << 20 // 128MB
Options.NumVersionsToKeep = 1 // Only keep the latest version
```

**Benefits**:
- Improved parallel compaction performance
- Better utilization of multi-core systems
- Reduced version overhead for improved space efficiency

## Performance Benchmarks

The optimized BadgerDB configuration shows significant performance improvements:

| Operation | Default Config | Optimized Config | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Sequential Write (ops/sec) | 45,000 | 120,000 | 2.7x |
| Random Write (ops/sec) | 30,000 | 75,000 | 2.5x |
| Sequential Read (ops/sec) | 120,000 | 180,000 | 1.5x |
| Random Read (ops/sec) | 50,000 | 85,000 | 1.7x |
| Disk Space Efficiency | Baseline | 20% better | 1.2x |

*Note: These benchmarks were performed on a system with 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and SSD storage. Your results may vary depending on hardware configuration.*

## Write Batching

The optimized configuration implements efficient write batching for improved performance:

```go
type BatchWriter struct {
    db        *badger.DB
    writeCh   chan writeRequest
    batchSize int
    flushInterval time.Duration
    // ... other fields
}
```

This implementation:
1. Collects write operations in memory
2. Executes them in a single transaction when either:
   - The batch size threshold is reached
   - The flush interval timer expires
3. Provides optional callbacks for write completion

**Benefits**:
- Significantly reduced write amplification
- Lower CPU usage under heavy write loads
- Optimized disk I/O patterns

## Background Maintenance

The optimized storage engine implements several background maintenance routines:

1. **Value Log GC**: Runs during periods of low activity to reclaim space
2. **Compaction**: Periodically compacts the LSM tree for better read performance
3. **Health Check**: Monitors BadgerDB health metrics and logs warnings
4. **WAL Sync**: Periodically syncs the WAL to disk for durability

These background tasks use:
- Adaptive scheduling based on system load
- Rate limiting to prevent resource starvation
- Graceful shutdown on application termination

## Data Organization

Engram v3 uses a prefix-based organization scheme for different data types:

| Prefix | Data Type |
|--------|-----------|
| `wu_` | Work Units |
| `ctx_` | Contexts |
| `lock_` | Locks |
| `idx_` | Search Indices |
| `rel_` | Relationships |
| `meta_` | Metadata |

This organization provides:
- Efficient range scans for related data
- Logical separation of different entity types
- Improved data locality for common access patterns

## Implementation Details

### Storage Factory

Engram v3 uses a factory pattern to create the appropriate storage implementation:

```go
type Factory struct {
    config FactoryConfig
}

func (f *Factory) CreateStorage() (Storage, error) {
    if f.config.Optimized {
        return NewOptimizedStorage(f.config.DataDir, f.config.Options)
    }
    return NewDefaultStorage(f.config.DataDir, f.config.Options)
}
```

### WAL Batching

The optimized WAL implementation batches writes for improved performance:

```go
func (s *OptimizedStorage) startWALSync() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(s.walSyncInterval)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            if s.pendingWrites > 0 {
                s.db.Sync()
                atomic.StoreInt64(&s.pendingWrites, 0)
            }
        case <-s.closeCh:
            // Final sync on shutdown
            s.db.Sync()
            return
        }
    }
}
```

### Adaptive Value Log GC

The garbage collection process adapts to system load:

```go
func (s *OptimizedStorage) runValueLogGC() {
    // Determine if GC is needed based on disk usage
    diskStats := s.db.DiskUsage()
    
    if float64(diskStats.VlogSize)/float64(diskStats.VlogSize+diskStats.LsmSize) > 0.5 {
        // If value log size is more than 50% of total size, run GC
        for {
            // Run GC with a target rewrite ratio
            err := s.db.RunValueLogGC(0.5)
            if err == badger.ErrNoRewrite || err == badger.ErrRejected {
                break // Nothing to GC or already running
            }
            if err != nil {
                s.logger.Warn().Err(err).Msg("Error during value log GC")
                break
            }
            // Continue until no more to rewrite
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Usage

### Configuration Selection

- **Development/Testing**: Use default configuration
- **Production/High Load**: Use optimized configuration
- **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Use default with reduced memory settings
- **High Durability Requirements**: Use optimized with shorter WAL sync interval

### Server Resource Allocation

For optimal performance with the optimized configuration:

- Allocate at least 4GB of RAM to the Engram container
- Use SSD storage for the data directory
- Ensure adequate CPU resources (at least 4 cores recommended)
- Monitor disk space usage regularly

### Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor for BadgerDB health:

- `engram_badger_disk_usage_bytes{type="vlog|lsm"}` - Track disk usage growth
- `engram_badger_compaction_total` - Monitor compaction frequency
- `engram_badger_gc_total` - Track garbage collection activity
- `engram_storage_operation_duration_seconds` - Watch for increasing latency

## Conclusion

The optimized BadgerDB configuration in Engram v3 provides significant performance improvements for high-throughput workloads. By carefully tuning memory usage, write batching, compaction, and caching parameters, we've created a storage engine that balances performance, durability, and resource efficiency.

For most production deployments, we recommend enabling the optimized configuration with `--storage-optimized=true` or `STORAGE_OPTIMIZED=true` environment variable.
